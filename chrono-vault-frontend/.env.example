# VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS Configuration
# ========================================
# The address of your deployed Vault smart contract on Base network.
# This is required for the frontend to interact with your smart contract.
#
# NETWORK SETUP GUIDE:
#
# 🌐 For Development/Testing (Base Sepolia Testnet):
#   1. Deploy your Vault contract to Base Sepolia testnet
#   2. Copy the deployed contract address
#   3. Example: VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
#
# 🚀 For Production (Base Mainnet):
#   1. Deploy your Vault contract to Base mainnet
#   2. Copy the deployed contract address
#   3. Example: VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd
#
# 💻 For Local Development:
#   Option A - Local Hardhat/Foundry network:
#     1. Deploy contract to your local network (e.g., Hardhat local, Anvil)
#     2. Use the local contract address
#     3. Example: VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
#
#   Option B - Test with existing testnet contract:
#     1. Use a deployed testnet contract address from your team
#     2. Share the address with your development team
#
# 🔗 Finding Contract Addresses:
#   - Base Sepolia: https://sepolia.basescan.org/
#   - Base Mainnet: https://basescan.org/
#   - Local: Check your deployment script output
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES:
#   - Always use the correct address for your target network
#   - Testnet and mainnet addresses are different and NOT interchangeable
#   - The frontend will fail to load if this address is incorrect or missing
#   - Contract must be verified on the blockchain explorer for best transparency
